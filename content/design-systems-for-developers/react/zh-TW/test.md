In chapter 5, we automate design system testing to prevent UI bugs. This chapter dives into what characteristics of UI components warrant testing and potential pitfalls to avoid. We researched professional teams at Wave, BBC, and Salesforce to land on a test strategy that balances comprehensive coverage, straightforward setup, and low maintenance.

## Fundamentals of UI component testing

Before we begin, let’s figure out what makes sense to test. Design systems are composed of UI components. Each UI component includes stories (permutations) that describe the intended look and feel given a set of inputs (props). Stories are then rendered by a browser or device for the end-user.

![Component states are combinatorial](/design-systems-for-developers/component-test-cases.png)

Whoa! As you can see, one component contains many states. Multiply the states by the number of design system components and you can see why keeping track of them all is a Sisyphean task. In reality, it’s unsustainable to review each experience by hand, especially as the design system grows.

All the more reason to set up automated testing **now** to save work in the **future**.

## Prepare to test

I surveyed 4 frontend teams in a [previous article](https://www.chromatic.com/blog/the-delightful-storybook-workflow) about professional Storybook workflows. They agreed on these best practices for writing stories to make testing easy and comprehensive.

**Articulate supported component states** as stories to clarify which combinations of inputs yields a given state. Ruthlessly omit unsupported states to reduce noise.

**Render components consistently** to mitigate variability that can be triggered by randomized (Math.random) or relative (Date.now) inputs.

> “The best kind of stories allow you to visualize all of the states your component could experience in the wild” – Tim Hingston, Tech lead at Apollo GraphQL

## Visual test appearance

Design systems contain presentational UI components, which are inherently visual. Visual tests validate the visual aspects of the rendered UI.

Visual tests capture an image of every UI component in a consistent browser environment. New screenshots are automatically compared to previously accepted baseline screenshots. When there are visual differences, you get notified.

![Visual test components](/design-systems-for-developers/component-visual-testing.gif)

If you’re building a modern UI, visual testing saves your frontend team from time-consuming manual review and prevents expensive UI regressions.

In the <a href="https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/review/#publish-storybook">previous chapter</a> we learned how to publish Storybook using [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/). We added a bold red border around each `Button` component and then requested feedback from teammates.

![Button red border](/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-button-border-change.png)

Now let's see how visual testing works using Chromatic's built in [testing tools](https://www.chromatic.com/features/test). When the pull request was created, Chromatic captured images for our changes and compared them to previous versions of the same components. 3 changes were found:

![List of checks in the pull request](/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-list-of-checks.png)

Click the **🟡UI Tests** check to review them.

![Second build in Chromatic with changes](/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-second-build-from-pr.png)

Review them to confirm whether they’re intentional (improvements) or unintentional (bugs). If you accept the changes, the test baselines will be updated. That means subsequent commits will be compared to the new baselines to detect bugs.

![Reviewing changes in Chromatic](/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-review-changes-pr.png)

In the last chapter, our teammate did not want a red border around the `Button`'s for some reason. Deny the changes to indicate that they need to be undone.

![Review deny in Chromatic](/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-review-deny.png)

Undo the changes and commit again to pass your visual tests again.

## Unit test functionality

Unit tests verify whether the UI code returns the correct output given a controlled input. They live alongside the component and help you validate specific functionality.

Everything is a component in modern view layers like React, Vue, and Angular. Components encapsulate diverse functionality from modest buttons to elaborate date pickers. The more intricate a component, the trickier it becomes to capture nuances using visual testing alone. That’s why we need unit tests.

![Unit test components](/design-systems-for-developers/component-unit-testing.gif)

For instance, our Link component is a little complicated when combined with systems that generate link URLs (“LinkWrappers” in ReactRouter, Gatsby, or Next.js). A mistake in the implementation can lead to links without a valid href value.

Visually, it isn’t possible to see if the `href` attribute is there and points to the right location, which is why a unit test can be appropriate to avoid regressions.

#### Unit testing hrefs

Let’s add a unit test for our `Link` component. create-react-app has set up a unit test environment for us already, so we can simply create a file `src/Link.test.js`:

```js:title=src/Link.test.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import { Link } from './Link';

/**
 * A straightforward link wrapper that renders an <a> with the passed props.
 * What we are testing here is that the Link component passes the right props to the wrapper and itself.
 */
const LinkWrapper = props => <a {...props} />; // eslint-disable-line jsx-a11y/anchor-has-content

it('has a href attribute when rendering with linkWrapper', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Link href="https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/" LinkWrapper={LinkWrapper}>
      Link Text
    </Link>,
    div
  );

  expect(div.querySelector('a[href="https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/"]')).not.toBeNull();
  expect(div.textContent).toEqual('Link Text');

  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);
});
```

We can run the above unit test as part of our `yarn test` command.

![Running a single Jest test](/design-systems-for-developers/jest-test.png)

Earlier we configured our GitHub Action to deploy Storybook, we can now adjust it to include testing as well. Our contributors will now benefit from this unit test. The Link component will be robust to regressions.

# ... Same as before

## Accessibility test

“Accessibility means all people, including those with disabilities, can understand, navigate, and interact with your app... Online [examples include] alternative ways to access content such as using the tab key and a screen reader to traverse a site.” writes developer [Alex Wilson from T.Rowe Price](https://medium.com/storybookjs/instant-accessibility-qa-linting-in-storybook-4a474b0f5347).

Disabilities affect 15% of the population according to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report/en/). Design systems have an outsized impact on accessibility because they contain the building blocks of user interfaces. Improving accessibility of just one component means every instance of that component across your company benefits.

![Storybook accessibility addon](/design-systems-for-developers/storybook-accessibility-addon.png)

Get a headstart on inclusive UI with Storybook’s Accessibility addon, a tool for verifying web accessibility standards (WCAG) in realtime.

```shell
yarn add --dev @storybook/addon-a11y

```

Add the addon in `.storybook/main.js`:

```diff:title=.storybook/main.js
module.exports = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: [
    '@storybook/addon-links',
    '@storybook/addon-essentials',
    '@storybook/preset-create-react-app',
+   '@storybook/addon-a11y',
  ],
};
```

Update your `.storybook/preview.js`'s [parameters](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/parameters) and add the following `a11y` configuration:

```diff:title=.storybook/preview.js

import React from 'react';

import { GlobalStyle } from '../src/shared/global';

export const decorators = [
  Story => (
    <>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <Story />
    </>
  ),
];

+ export const parameters = {
+   actions: { argTypesRegex: '^on[A-Z].*' },
+   // Storybook a11y addon configuration
+   a11y: {
+     // the target DOM element
+     element: '#root',
+     // sets the execution mode for the addon
+     manual: false,
+   },
+ };
```

Once all is setup, you’ll see a new “Accessibility” tab in the Storybook addons panel.

![Storybook a11y addon](/design-systems-for-developers/storybook-addon-a11y-6-0.png)

This shows you accessibility levels of DOM elements (violations and passes). Click the “highlight results” checkbox to visualize violations in situ with the UI component.

<video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>
  <source
    src="/design-systems-for-developers/storybook-addon-a11y-6-0-highlighted.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

From here, follow the addon’s accessibility recommendations.

## Other testing strategies

Paradoxically, tests can save time but also bog down development velocity with maintenance. Be judicious about testing the right things – not everything. Even though software development has many test strategies, we discovered the hard way that some aren’t suited for design systems.

#### Snapshot tests (Jest)

This technique captures the code output of UI components and compares it to previous versions. Testing UI component markup ends up testing implementation details (code), not what the user experiences in the browser.

Diffing code snapshots is unpredictable and prone to false positives. At the component level, code snapshotting doesn’t account for global changes like design tokens, CSS, and 3rd party API updates (web fonts, Stripe forms, Google Maps, etc.). In practice, developers resort to “approving all” or ignoring snapshot tests altogether.

> Most component snapshot tests are really just a worse version of screenshot tests. Test your outputs. Snapshot what gets rendered, not the underlying (volatile!) markup. – Mark Dalgliesh, Frontend infrastructure at SEEK, CSS modules creator

#### End-to-end tests (Selenium, Cypress)

End-to-end tests traverse the component DOM to simulate the user flow. They’re best suited for verifying app flows like the signup or checkout process. The more complex functionality the more useful this testing strategy.

Design systems contain atomic components with relatively simple functionality. Validating user flows are often overkill for this task because the tests are time-consuming to create and brittle to maintain. However, in rare situations, components may benefit from end-to-end tests. For instance, validating complex UIs like datepickers or self-contained payment forms.

## Drive adoption with documentation

A design system is not complete with tests alone. Since design systems serve stakeholders from across the organization, we need to teach others how to get the most from our well-tested UI components.

In chapter 6, we’ll learn how to accelerate design system adoption with documentation. See why Storybook Docs is a secret weapon to create comprehensive docs with less work.
